=== Conformance classes

This document establishes 9 conformance classe(s):

- DGIWG process,
- DGIWG process profile for elevation analysis,
- DGIWG process profile for distance measurement,
- DGIWG process profile for range rings,
- DGIWG process profile for viewshed analysis,
- DGIWG process profile for slope analysis,
- DGIWG process profile for helicopter landing zone,
- DGIWG process profile for routing,
- DGIWG process profile for geopackage creation.


*_"DGIWG process"_* class define requirements for defining generic process description

*_"DGIWG process profile for X"_* classes define generic process profiles according to "DGIWG process" conformance class. Process profiles are blueprints for process implementations and are meant to harmonize process implementations to a certain degree. They serve as a reference for process implementations by providing a description of what the process actually does. These are defined at a generic level, meaning, these processes profiles may be implemented by OGC WPS standards (versions 1 or 2) or possibly other geoprocessing APIs.
<<annex-a.adoc#AbstractTestSuite>> lists the conformance abstract tests which shall be exercised on process profiles claiming to implement these conformance classes.

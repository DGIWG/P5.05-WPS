== DGIWG Processes Description (Normative)

=== Introduction
This chapter defines DGIWG processes at a generic level. These definitions may be implemented through WPS or other APIs.
Following DGIWG processes are desribed below:

 - elevation analysis
 - distance mesurement
 - range rings
 - viewshed
 - slope
 - helicopter landing zone
 - geocoding
 - routing
 - geopackage
